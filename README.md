# Explatory-Data-Analysis-on-Fifa19-Dataset

In this project, I did exploratory data analysis to understand a dataset and its features. I have created a table and then explored some features. This project is about how to use the python library datascience to do basic data exploration.

For this assignment, I used a data set from kaggle.com and downloaded the csv
(comma separated values) dataset from the following link:
